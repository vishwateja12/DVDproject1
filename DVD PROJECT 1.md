 ###                           STAGE 1 :- Single Transistor Leakages



#### AIM : NMOS_ON,PMOS_ON,NMOS_OFF,PMOS_OFF Leakages

##### Below Shown are the leakges for the NMOS,PMOS

![Maximum gate oxide and subthreshold leakage current states in nMOS and... |  Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3338083/figure/fig3/AS:671509282553869@1537111697394/Maximum-gate-oxide-and-subthreshold-leakage-current-states-in-nMOS-and-pMOS-transistors.png)

In A Both the NMOS and PMOS are in ON stage and the major leakages are the gate and body leakages. where in B Both the PMOS and NMOS are in OFF stage the major leakage we can see are sub threshold leakage with a less gate and body leakages.

Now we code these in the NGSpice to look up on what are the values of the single transistor leakages 

###### CODE SNIPPET :

.include 22nm_HP.pm
.option GMIN=1e-020 ABSTOL=1e-18 temp=25

.param Lmin=22n
.param Wmin=22n
.param Ldiff=44n

M1 drain gate source body nmos W={Wmin} L={Lmin} AS={Wmin*Ldiff} AD={Wmin*Ldiff} PS={2*(Ldiff+Wmin)} PD={2*(Ldiff+Wmin)}
Vd 	drain	  0     0
Vg 	gate	  alim	0
Vs 	source	0		  0
Vb 	body	  0		  0

Vdd alim	  0

.control
echo "" > W1nmos_ON_simulation_results.txt
let voltage=0
let Vddbasic=0.8
while voltage le Vddbasic
  let voltage = voltage + 0.01
  alter Vdd = voltage
  dc TEMP 25 50 60
  print @M1[W] abs(V(alim)) V(drain) V(gate) V(source) V(body) I(Vd) I(Vg) I(Vs) I(Vb)
  let i = @M1[W]
  echo "25" "$&i" "$&voltage" "$&V(drain)" "$&V(source)" "$&V(gate)" "$&V(body)" "$&I(Vd)" "$&I(Vg)" "$&I(Vs)" "$&I(Vb)" >> W1nmos_ON_simulation_results.txt
end
.endc
.end



The above shown case is for nmos on and we saved all these values into text file using echo command and saved them in matrix format using python script.

just run the net file inside single transitor and the pmos off and on or nmos off and on by changing the widths and saving it in respective text files. the text files are saved inside the folders and we can look up into them while using it in expectations.

![Screenshot from 2024-03-27 21-25-47](/home/vishwa/Pictures/Screenshot from 2024-03-27 21-25-47.png)

These files are filled with netlists and the respective text files



###                  STAGE 2 : NStack and PStack Intermediate Voltages



#### AIM : NStack,PStack Intermediate Voltages to estimate the leakages in stacks



â€‹           For Nstack and Pstack there will be 4 different inputs as 00,01,10,11 and the intermediate voltages are saved in the text files with leakages

**CODE :**

.include 22nm_HP.pm
.options GMIN=1e-020 ABSTOL=1e-18

.param Lmin=22n
.param Wmin=22n
.param Ldiff=44n

	let leakage_gate = abs(I(vg1))+abs(I(vg2))
	let leakage_sub = abs(I(vs))
	print @M1[W] @M2[W] V(D1) V(S1) V(G1) V(G2) V(S2) V(B1) V(B2) I(Vd) I(Vg1) I(Vg2) I(Vs) I(Vb1) I(Vb2) leakage_body leakage_gate leakage_sub
	echo "25" "$&i1" "$&V(D1)" "$&V(S1)" "$&V(G1)" "$&V(B1)" "$&i2" "$&V(S1)" "$&V(S2)" "$&V(G2)" "$&V(B2)" >> nmos_00.txt
end
.endc
.end

Above is an example code for the stack of nmos with 00 input. In 00 and 01 and 10 cases there is no channel so the vdd is kept at the top and gnd at the bottom source of nmos and for the case of 11 both the ends are kept at gnd as there is a channel simillar way for 00 case in pmos stack both the ends at vdd and in other cases vds is kept at negative vdd and will look for the leakages and printed in text files

As in the case of atleast 1 transistor is off then the other transister intermediate voltage is updated to make the sub threshold leakage unchanged.

**Below is the example text file for nstack with intermediate voltages :**

**vn00 = [0.133388,0.13336,0.133359,0.133359,0.133358,0.133358]**
**vn01 = [2.07744E-05,2.19535E-05,2.33051E-05,2.39811E-05,2.46572E-05,2.49954E-05]**
**vn10 = [0.666334,0.666317,0.666318,0.666319,0.666319,0.66632]**
**vn11 = [2.86192E-08,3.91613E-08,4.15407E-08,4.27302E-08,4.39197E-08,4.45144E-08]**

As this concludes we manually checked the leakages of each gate body and subthreshold and verified with the printed values from netlist.



###        STAGE 3 : Estimation of the leakages of FA circuit of **74182** 





![img](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jhayes/iscas.restore/74182gates.gif)

We go through the stage in 3 parts Verifying each of the gates as OR,NOR,AND,NOT gates leakages with the expected values in python.

* PART-1 : Each gates verification
* PART-2 : design the FA circuit as netlist and get the leakages
* PART-3 : FInal look up into the FA leakage estimation

The W/L values are optimised to make sure that the transistors are accomodated to give the current that flows as sub treshold currents as we make same at vdd and vss to be same and the making pmos/nmos ratio to be approximately 2 making this there is no need of external leakages from gates to match up with the sub treshold.

The right one shows the python output of the leakage in the estimation stage

### PYTHON CODE RUNNING 

![Screenshot from 2024-03-27 22-08-36](/home/vishwa/Pictures/Screenshot from 2024-03-27 22-08-36.png)

With the above function that determined we can find the Final leakage of the the FA circuit above 0's shown are the inputs of the Final Circuit.



###                                                          HOW TO RUN THE CODES



1. FInd the FInal_circuit.net inside zip and give inputs as you wish at the voltage sources
2. Go to Final_model.py and give the same inputs that you gave in the Final_circuit.net and compare the leakages from both of them.
